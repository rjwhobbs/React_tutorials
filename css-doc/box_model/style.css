/* A key thing to understand about margins is the concept of margin collapsing. 
If you have two elements whose margins touch, and both margins are positive, 
those margins will combine to become one margin, which is the size of the 
largest individual margin. If one or both margins are negative, the amount of 
negative value will subtract from the total.

In the example below, we have two paragraphs. The top paragraph has a 
margin-bottom of 50 pixels. The second paragraph has a margin-top of 30 pixels. 
The margins have collapsed together so the actual margin between the boxes is 50 
pixels and not the total of the two margins. */
